Plots were 1.5 ft wide and 8 ft long with 2 ft alleys between plots. The turfgrass swards were mature stands of U-3, Riviera, and Tifway 419 bermudagrass cultivars planted on a Norge loam soil. For each cultivar, the experimental design was a split-block, where Primo MAXX growth regulator treatments were whole plots applied in strips across each replicated block and sub-plots were fungicide treatments. There were four replicates for each cultivar trial. Mowing height was 3 in. Recommended maintenance practices were followed throughout the growing season. Fungicides were applied with a CO, pressurized wheelbarrow sprayer equipped with TX8008 flat fan nozzles and calibrated to deliver 87 GPA or 2 gal/1000 ft. Primo MAXX IEC was applied at 0.38 fl oz/1000 ft using the same spraying apparatus. Fungicides and growth regulator treatments were first applied on 3 Jul and applied at 14-day intervals. Ratings of phytotoxicity scale of 0 - 10 where 0 no change, slight change in turfgrass appearance, 5 distinct change in turfgrass appearance, 10 very abnormal turfgrass and turfgrass quality scale of 1 - 9 scale where 1 no turf present, 5 unacceptable turfgrass, 7 acceptable turf, 9 dense, dark color, thick stand of turfgrass were taken on 7 Aug during a period of severe heat stress. Turf phytotoxicity and quality data were analyzed using ANOVA a 0.05 for each cultivar, separately. Multiple comparisons of means were performed using Fishers test of protected least significant difference a 0.05. The bermudagrasses selected for this study represent common U-3, vegetative hybrid Tifway 419, and seeded hybrid Riviera bermudagrasses that are commonly grown throughout the southern United States. The application of Primo MAXX 1EC whole plot effect on the cultivar U-3 significantly P 0.02 increased the level of phytotoxicity 1.81 and significantly P 0.02 reduced quality 8.10 versus not applying growth regulator phytotoxicity 0.97; quality 8.49. The same was true for Riviera where applications of growth regulator significantly P 0.01 increased the level of phytotoxicity 2.22 and significantly P 0.001 reduced quality 7.86 versus not applying growth regulator phytotoxicity 0.92; quality 8.40. No effects of growth regulator application were identified for the cultivar Tifway 419. An effect of fungicides sub-plot effect on turfgrass phytotoxicity and quality was only observed for the cultivar U-3. U-3 bermudagrass treated with Banner MAXX 1.24 MEC, Bayleton 50 WG, and Eagle 40 WP had higher levels of phytotoxicity and lower turfgrass quality than non-fungicide treated control plots. Plots treated with Trinity 1.67 SC at 1.5 fl oz/1000ft exhibited higher levels of phytotoxicity and lower turfgrass quality than non-fungicide treated check plots, but was not significantly different from plots treated with Eagle 40WP. Plots treated with all other rates of the fungicide Trinity 1.67 SC exhibited levels of phytotoxicity and turfgrass quality that were comparable to non-fungicide treated control plots.

Plot dimension was 21-ft x 100-ft, with 4 replications in RCB design. At application, air temperature was 80 F and soil temperature at 4-in depth was 79 F. Soil moisture was near field capacity. Soil type was a loamy sand, pH 6.1. The area had a history of nematode infestation, particularly with Belonolaimus sp. sting nematode. Plots were maintained by the golf course staff and were mowed at 0.5 in weekly. Curfew 1,3-dichloropropene was injected behind vertical coulter plates mounted on a tractor implement. Coulters were on 12-in centers and coulter depth adjusted to slice turf and inject fumigant approximately 5-in deep. Nemacur fenamiphos was applied using a drop spreader. Immediately after treatments were applied the experimental area was irrigated with approximately 0.25-in water. Turf quality measurements and soil samples for nematode analyses were taken on 26 Jul, 13 Aug, and 10 Sep. Turf quality was assessed 1 to 9 scale, with 9 being best by dividing plots into 4 equal quadrats and the quality averaged in each plot before statistical analysis. Samples were taken for nematode analysis with a standard 1- in soil probe. Soil cores were taken about 4-5 in deep, with 30 soil cores collected from the center of each plot in a zigzag pattern. Samples were bulked in a plastic bucket, mixed and stored in labeled plastic bags. Samples were kept in an ice chest to moderate temperatures and assayed immediately by elutriation and sugar flotation. Values of nematode counts are in numbers/100 ml of soil. Plots were examined 4 days after application for evidence of fumigant injury. There was a slight amount of injury yellowing of foliage adjacent to the coulter slice that extended approximately 1-in either side of the sliced turf.

The area was mapped on 17 Jun 99 to determine spring dead spot SDS disease incidence and severity in order to randomize treatments within the blocks prior to treatment initiation on 20 Aug 99. Plant roots were surface sterilized and ectotrophic root-infecting fungi were isolated that had colony morphology similar to the Ophiosphaerella species. O. korrae was confirmed the causal agent through positive amplification of suspected isolate fungal DNA with O. korrae-ribosomal specific polymerase chain reaction primers. Plots were rated for the number of SDS patches and percent plot area that was assumed to be necrotic as a result of root infection of SDS fungi. Data were analyzed using the SAS PROC GLM procedure and significantly different treatment means were separated using Fisher's protected LSD procedures at the P 0.05 level.\\\"]"}

The greens mix consisted of a Cecil clay loam soil, which has been modified with topdressing sand and a soil pH of 6.1. The greens mix was fumigated 8 Oct 99 with 98% methyl bromide and 2% chloropicrin and established 16 Oct 99 to A-4 creeping bentgrass that was seeded at 1.25 lb per 1000 sq ft. From 13 Oct 99, the test area was reel mowed at 0.156-in. height with a Toro Triplex Greensmaster four times per week. From establishment, the test area received 4.5 lb N per 1000 sq ft per yr from a Scotts 26-4-12 Contec HP fertilizer plus minors. For the 2000 calendar year, the final spring and initial fall fertilizations occurred on 13 May and 27 Sep, respectively. Plot size was 3 ft 4 in. x 5 ft replicated four times in a randomized complete block design. Fungicide applications were applied preventively initiated on 15 Jun in 3.2 gal H,O per 1000 sq ft with a backpack CO,-pressurized 38 psi sprayer equipped with two flat-fan TeeJet 8010 nozzles on a 20 in. spacing. Treatments were applied between 7:00 and 9:00, just after the turfgrass had been mowed, to allow for maximum fungicide absorption to the turfgrass canopy. Fungicide treatments were not watered-in following application. Plots were inoculated the evening of 15 Jun with a R. solani AG2-2A infested grain blend of equal proportion of cracked corn, oats, wheat, and barley that was hand spread on the turfgrass canopy to deliver 1.45 Ib grain per 1000 sq ft. Inoculum was gathered on 19 Jun through collecting it in the basket of a Toro walk behind Greensmaster 500 mower. Symptoms of brown patch were not distinctly evident until 29 Jun when the initial disease ratings were taken. Disease severity was assessed visually as a percent of plot area blighted on a 0 to 100% scale where 0 no blighting and 100 entire plot area blighted. Turfgrass blight ratings exceeding one and five percent would be considered commercially unacceptable control of Curvularia sp. and R. solani, respectively on a golf course putting green. Algae infestation exceeding five percent would be considered commercially unacceptable control of algae on a golf course putting green. Data were analyzed using the SAS PROC GLM procedure and significantly different treatment means were separated using Fisher's protected LSD procedures at the P 0.05 level.\\\"]"}

All data was subject to analysis of variance and means were separated using Fishers LSD. The experimental area developed brown patch naturally in late-Jun. Disease pressure was high throughout the trial period with a maximum of 74% observed in the non-treated check on 31 Jul. Throughout the trial, all fungicides significantly reduced brown patch symptoms compared to the non- treated check, except Zio. Banner Maxx II had reduced efficacy when extending the first application interval beyond 14 d on 6 Jul, but continued applications reduced brown patch compared to the non-treated check on 3 of 4 rating dates. Velista 0.7 oz and Exteris Stressgard 4.0 fl oz greatly reduced brown patch infection until 17 Aug when brown patch increased in both treatments. Weekly applications of Rhapsody 10.0 fl oz provided significant reductions in brown patch and were comparable to multiple synthetic fungicides on observation dates prior to 31 July. Brown patch in Rhapsody treated plots increased similar to the non-treated check once weekly applications ended in early Aug. Zio 3.0 oz applications were not different from the non-treated check. Future work to evaluate frequent applications of Zio i.e., 7 days may show similar reductions to Rhapsody.']"}

Alone or in combination with Banner MAXX, Petro- Canada EXP suppressed dollar spot compared to the control. During peak dollar spot pressure in Sep plot damage exceeded 10% in several treatments and included, Daconil Ultrex, Insignia, Petro-Canada EXP, Rhapsody, Banner MAXX, and Petro-Canada EXP + Banner MAXX. Best dollar spot suppression never exceeding 5% was provided by the 14 day treatments of Dew Cure, Tourney, and Trinity, as well as by the 21 day treatments of Clearys 26/36, Clearys CX-15, and Emerald. For the season, the curative Daconil Ultrex + Emerald required fewest application number total using 3 versus 9 for the 14 day preventive schedule and 6 for the 21 day preventive schedule.']"}

The study was conducted at the North Carolina State University Turfgrass Field Lab in Raleigh, NC on Penn A-1 creeping bentgrass maintained as a golf course putting green. The turf was mown S to 6 times per week at 0.150 in. with clippings collected. The study was irrigated regularly to prevent drought stress. Individual plots were 3 ft x 6 ft and arranged in a randomized complete block design with 4 replications. Treatments were applied with a CO,-powered sprayer equipped with TeeJet AI9508E nozzles at 50 psi and a carrier volume of 2 gal per 1000 ft. Treatments were initiated on 3 May with the exception of Secure Action, which was first applied on 17 May. Fungicides were applied on 14-day intervals throughout the study. Plant growth regulators, when applied, were on 7 or 14 day intervals. Dollar spot severity was visually assessed as percent plot area affected every 7 to 14 days beginning on 30 May lasting until 24 Jul. Brown patch severity was visually assessed every 14 days as percent plot area affected beginning on 26 Jun lasting until 24 Jul. Turfgrass quality was assessed based on color, density, texture, and uniformity 9best, 6acceptable every 1 to 2 weeks. Phytotoxicity was also assessed every to 2 weeks throughout the study and was based on a 0-5 scale Onone, 5turfgrass death. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and means were separated using Fishers Protected LSD p0.05. Dollar spot and brown patch pressure was severe in the non-treated controls averaging 5.75% and 22.8%, respectively. All fungicide treatments suppressed dollar spot and brown patch, but no treatments were statistically different from one another. All treatments except for the tank mixture of Daconil Action, Appear, Primo Maxx, and Cutless at a 7-day PGR interval had significantly better turf quality than the non-treated control. Phytotoxicity was only observed when Primo Maxx and Cutless were applied at 7-day intervals, which likely contributed to reduced turf quality.']"}

The turfgrass was mowed three times weekly at a height of 0.5 in. Depending on treatments, fungicides were applied approximately every 14, 21, or 28 days from 8 Jun to 22 Sep. Individual plots, measuring 3 ft x 6 ft, were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. All the treatments were applied preventively using a CO,-pressurized handheld sprayer equipped with a TeeJet air induction AI9504E nozzle calibrated to deliver water equivalent to 1 gal/1000 ft at 40 psi. No phytotoxicity was observed during the study period. Since brown patch did not occur naturally, plots were inoculated using rye and wheat seeds colonized with Rhizoctonia solani 10 cc per plot on 15 Jun. Urea 46-0-0 was applied at the rate of 0.9 Ib/1000 ft? on 14 Apr and 0.5 1b/1000 ft on 7 Jul to promote disease development. Herbicide applications included Lesco Bentgrass Selective on 11 Apr, Dithiopyr L on 13 Apr and 5 Jul, and Sedgehammer on 2 Aug for weed management. Boscalid fungicide was preventatively sprayed at the label rate of 0.18 fl oz/1000 ft? on 14 Jun, 29 Jun, 20 Jul, 2 Aug, and 15 Aug to control dollar spot. Brown patch severity was visually assessed as a percentage of plot area affected with disease between 10 Jul and 20 Sep. The area under the disease progress curve AUDPC was calculated to evaluate the seasonal progress of brown patch using the following equation: AUDPC >}\\\\y;+yi+1/2 t+:-t;, where y; and yj; represent disease rating at two consecutive dates, t; and t;.; represent the corresponding rating dates, and n represents the number of days between the first and last rating dates. Data was subjected to analysis of variance and mean separation was performed using Fisher's least significant difference LSD at a 0.05. The initial symptoms appeared in the non-treated plots on 25 Jul. Throughout the observation period, the severity of the disease in non-treated plots increased notably, with a maximum severity of 42.5% by 8 Sep. This progression was significantly higher compared to the treated plots, as evidenced by the high AUDPC of 1022.4 in the non-treated control compared to treated plots with AUDPCs equal or lower than 72.0. Alternation of a higher rate of Tuque exoGEM with Secure Action provided the same results as individual applications of Tuque exoGEM where brown patch severity was 0.0% throughout the season. The alternation treatments of lower rate of Tuque exoGEM with Secure Action and Ascernity with Secure Action significantly reduced the disease compared to the non-treated control.\\\"]"}

Daconil Weatherstik 3.0 fl 0z/1000 sq ft was applied on 14 Apr to suppress dollar spot symptoms that developed prior to trial initiation. On 16 Jun, rye grain Secale cereale L. infested with the dollar spot pathogen was uniformly applied at a volume of 1.52-in.* per plot using a small broadcast spreader and left on the turf surface for 3 days before mowing. All other diseases developed from natural inoculum. Disease severity and turfgrass quality were assessed every 14 days from initial symptom development. Disease severity was assessed as a visual estimate of the percent symptomatic area and counts of infection centers per plot. Turfgrass quality was evaluated using a to 9 scale 9best, 6acceptable based on color, density, and uniformity. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and means separation using Fishers protected LSD P0.05. Dollar spot symptoms < 0.3% severity and < 0.5 infection centers per plot were present in the trial area at trial initiation. Traction and Pinpoint treated plots had less dollar spot infection centers per plot than the untreated control, except Pinpoint on 4 Oct. Traction treated plots had significantly fewer dollar spot infection centers per plot than Pinpoint on 12 Jul, and 20 Sep, 4 weeks following the final application WFFA. Brown patch symptoms were first observed in the trial area on 14 Jun. On 26 Jul, treated plots had less brown patch severity than the untreated control. Acceptable turf quality 6 was noted in fungicide treated plots from 14 Jun 6 Sep. From 12 Jul 4 Oct, turf quality in treated plots was significantly higher than the untreated control. On 12 Jul and 9 and 20 Sep, turf quality in Traction treated plots was significantly higher than Pinpoint. By 4 Oct, 6 WFFA, turf quality in all plots was unacceptable < 6 due to an increase in dollar spot control. No phytotoxicity was observed in this trial.']"}

Briskway applications were evaluated for disease control and potential phytotoxicity at the University of Missouri Turfgrass Research Facility in Columbia, MO on a Penncross creeping bentgrass naturally infested with Sclerotinia homoeocarpa. The green contained a 12-in sand root zone over a drained subgrade. Mowing was performed at a height of 0.13-in., three and five times weekly from 2 Apr to 7 Jun and 7 Jun to 19 Sep, respectively. Nitrogen was applied at 0.20 lb N/1000 sq ft on 18 Apr. and every 3 wks thereafter at 0.39 lb N/1000 sq ft from 16 May to 29 Aug. Revolution 6.0 fl oz/1000 sq ft was applied every 28-d starting on 16 May. Three applications of Daconil Ultrex 3.25 02/1000 sq ft were applied on 14-d intervals from 7 May 3 Jun across the entire trial area to prevent disease occurrence before trial initiation. On 17 Jun, an additional Daconil Ultrex 3.25 0z/1000 sq ft was made only to plots slated to receive 0.725 and 1.45 fl oz/1000 sq ft of Briskway to prevent disease occurrence before initial applications were made on 1 Jul. Plots were 5 x 5 ft and arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Treatments were applied in water equivalent to 2 gal/1000 sq ft with a CO -powered sprayer at 26 psi using TeeJet 8008 flat fan nozzles. Briskway treatments were applied from 17 Jun 15 Jul, three times at 0.5 or 1.0 fl oz 0z/1000 sq ft, or twice at 0.725 or 1.45 fl oz/1000 sq ft on a 14 d interval. These treatments represent low and high rates of Briskway, and a potential high rate spray overlap. Disease severity and turfgrass quality were assessed every 14-d from initial symptom development. Brown patch was assessed as a visual estimate of the percent symptomatic area and dollar spot was quantified as counts of infection centers per plot.

Phytotoxicity was evaluated using a 0 to 9 scale with 0 none, > 2 unacceptable discoloration, and 9 total plot necrosis. Data were subjected to analysis of variance and means separation using Fishers Protected LSD test P0.05. Dollar spot was first observed in the trial area on 3 Jun. From 1 Jul 12 Aug, all plots treated with Briskway regardless of timing or application rate had significantly less dollar spot severity than the untreated control. By 12 Aug, 4 weeks following the final application dollar spot incidence was lowest in plots treated with two applications of Briskway at 1.45 fl oz/1000 sq ft. Brown patch was first observed on 1 Jul. All treated plots had significantly less brown patch severity than the untreated control from 29 Jul 26 Aug. No significant differences were noted in brown patch control among Briskway treatments. On 26 Aug, blue-green algae was observed within the trial area following multiple rainfall events. All treated plots had significantly less blue-green algae incidence than the untreated control. Turfgrass quality was high >7 in Briskway-treated plots until dollar spot incidence reduced quality on 12 and 26 Aug below acceptable levels.

Treatment plots measured 3 ft x 10 ft and were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Treatments were applied as a foliar spray in water equivalent to 2.1 gal/1000 ft using a CO>-powered walk-behind sprayer equipped with dual TeeJet 8002 nozzles. Overhead irrigation was applied immediately after treatment through a hose calibrated to deliver 0.125 acre-inch. Treatments were initiated on 9 Jun and applied at 14 d schedules through 4 Aug. Pythium root rot i.e., percentage diseased turf area/plot was assessed every 7-14 d throughout the trial period. All data was subject to analysis of variance and means were separated using Fishers least significant difference. Pythium root rot developed naturally across the experimental site in early July. Some variation was observed initially, but continued disease progression resulted in more uniform symptom development. Across all rating dates, Zelto + Select Phite 3 fl oz did not significantly impact Pythium root rot when compared to the non-treated control. Except for Zelto + Select Phite 3 fl oz, all remaining treatments significantly reduced Pythium root rot compared to the non-treated control on 7 July when disease pressure was low. Continued disease progression in mid-July showed Azoxy Bio 0.9 fl oz, Zelto + Select Phite 6 fl oz, and Segway 0.45 fl oz treated plots had significantly less Pythium root rot than the non-treated control on 19-July, and only Zelto + Select Phite 6 fl oz and Segway 0.45 fl oz were able to significantly reduce disease compared to the non-treated control on 29 Jul. On the final date, Segway 0.45 fl oz was the only treatment able to significantly reduce Pythium root rot compared to the non-treated control. These results show that biological products tested offer some benefit to reducing Pythium root rot under low disease pressure, but may break down under severe pressure experienced on creeping bentgrass in Florence, SC.']"}

Phytotoxicity in creeping bentgrass was not observed at any time following application of the fungicide treatments tested in this study. A significant P < 0.10 darker green coloration of the turfgrass foliage was observed in response to the TurfVigor treatment on 31 Aug when average daily temperatures dropped below 75 F. No other significant effects on plant physiology were observed. Significant P < 0.05 effects on control of dollar spot in creeping bentgrass were not observed after initiation of the study until 31 Aug when environmental conditions favored a moderate epidemic of dollar spot. All fungicide treatments provided significant control on 31 Aug as compared to the water control. TurfVigor and EXP 10887A applied at 1.0 oz had significantly reduced dollar spot control as compared to other fungicides examined in this study on 31 Aug. Additionally, EXP 10887A applied at 1.0 oz did not provide significant control on 14 Sep. TurfVigor failed to provide significant control between 7 Sep and 24 Sep once moderate disease pressure was established. All other fungicide treatments provided significant control of dollar spot on creeping bentgrass between 7 Sep and 24 Sep regardless of application rate.']"}
